A mobile app for the restaurant Little Lemon. In this app, you can register and customize your profile. You can browse the menu and discover the dishes that interest you most. The app includes filters to help you find what you like—for example, starters, mains, desserts, or drinks. You can also search by typing keywords in a bar.

At the moment, the app only lets you view the dishes and their prices. Soon, we will add features to place orders directly from the app and provide more detailed information about each dish, such as calories and ingredients.

To preview the app on your phone, follow these steps:
